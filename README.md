# Gdb raw bytes (Python)
USAGE:

1. Modify the designated array on the source code with you byte injections.
2. Run the script. After selecting the program to debug, you can type "pyc (command index from array)". Ex. "pyc 0". You can also use "python -c (command)" and "python -s (your .py file)"
3. Enjoy the overflows!

#note: I am aware there is a python implementention on gdb, however, if you somehow found me first and are looking for a simple no headache solution, you can use this.
And i know, it is barebones but it should work fine.
